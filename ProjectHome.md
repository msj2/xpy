Supporting all versions from Windows 2000 to Windows 7 (Windows 8 is yet untested), _xpy_ allows tweaking the default settings to your needs. This includes the disabling of services, changing the behaviour and usability, deleting undesired files, or tweaking programs like Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player and Windows Messenger.

It is recommended to **use _xpy_ with care**, it's not everybody's solution to make your Windows run better. Use it with care and it will help you making changes to your operating system much quicker.

**To all Vispa users:**
Vispa was once a stripped down, Windows Vista optimized version of xpy. As of _xpy 1.2_, both projects have been merged and Vispa is no longer maintained or even updated. If you use Windows Vista or later, get the latest version of xpy.
